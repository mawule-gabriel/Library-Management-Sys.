It includes features for book and patron management, allowing librarians to track and organize library materials and user accounts. The system also supports transaction tracking, enabling easy monitoring of book checkouts, returns, and fines.

## Major Features 🔑
### Dashboard View
The Dashboard View serves as the homepage of the Library Management System, providing an intuitive interface for library staff to navigate seamlessly to all essential sections. From this central hub, staff can access the Reservation section to manage book bookings, the Patron section to oversee user accounts and activities, and the Staff Management area to handle staff-related tasks. Additionally, the system offers easy access to the Transaction section for tracking book checkouts, returns, and fines, as well as the Books section for managing library inventory. This streamlined design ensures that library staff can efficiently perform all necessary operations in one convenient location.
